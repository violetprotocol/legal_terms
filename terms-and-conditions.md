Terms of Use

Last updated: September 11, 2022

Introduction
To provide Violet’s services to you, DeFi Labs GmbH (“we”, “our”, “us” or “Company”) must have your (“you,” “your” or “User”) agreement to these Terms of Use (“the Terms”).  By accessing or using Violet, you expressly consent and agree to be bound by and comply with these Terms. 

If you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of a business, you represent to us that you have the authority to bind that business or entity to these Terms, and that business or entity accepts these terms. We encourage you to read these Terms carefully and use them to make informed decisions.

Description of the Service
Violet is a highly customizable compliance and identity management tool provided by DeFi Labs. The purpose of Violet is to provide a standardized method to issue compliance credentials and map smart-contract access controls on the Ethereum mainnet as well as some EVM-compatible chains.

Violet facilitates verifying your identity and authenticating your transactions without disclosing your personal information other than your wallet address, when requested by a third party, if you pass the Violet’s Know Your Customer (“KYC”), Know Your Business (“KYB”) screens, and any other compliance screens that may be applicable to your transaction. After you complete the enrollment process, Violet may, in its sole discretion, provide you with a credential (the “VioletID”) that you may use to access Services provided by certain third parties (the “Service”).

By registering and receiving a Violet credential, Violet will provide these services:

Identity Management: enrollment, authentication, and other self-service procedures for managing identity credentials on- and off-chain (forming the VioletID), which allow Violet to verify a user’s real-world identity.

Compliance Management: enrollment and ongoing background procedures for managing compliance credentials (on- and off-chain) to ensure that VioletID holders fulfill the requirements of specific compliance regimes necessary to engage in permissioned transactions.

Data Management: encryption and storage of off-chain credentials – in particular, identity and compliance credentials – as well as pseudonymized audit log data.

Credential Management: issuing tokens and proofs – on- and off-chain – that allow other components or parties to verify compliance and identity information.

Access Management: providing a functional “Access Token” in the form of a signed message that is used to pass trusted compliance information from our off-chain system to on-chain smart contracts as part of your transaction. Access Tokens contain no direct personal information of the user, revealing only that the wallet address has successfully enrolled and authenticated vs. the compliance required by the relevant smart contract.

If at any time you no longer meet the requirements for the VioletID, we will revoke it. 

Eligibility and Proof of Identity
To use Violet, you represent that (1) you are at least 18 years of age or older (for US-based users) or older than the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which you reside, and are otherwise capable of entering into binding contracts, and (2) you have the right, authority and capacity to accept these Terms and to abide by these Terms, and that you will do so. 

You also will be required to submit certain personal information to verify your identity and provide you with your VioletID. Our collection, use, and retention of this information will be governed by our privacy policy, which you may review here. By using the Service and agreeing to these terms, you agree that you have read and reviewed the Privacy Policy.

For corporate entities, we may require identification information related to the directors, officers or equity owners of the business. You represent and warrant at all times that all information provided by you to us is true, accurate, and not misleading in any respect. If any such information changes, it is your obligation to provide the new information to us as soon as practicable following such change.

Service is unavailable where prohibited by law. Violet will use its sole and absolute discretion to revise the list of prohibited jurisdictions, reject specific applications, or limit use of part or all of the Service, as required by law.

Revisions to Terms and Disclosures
From time-to-time, Violet may update or change these Terms, for reasons like adhering to legal and compliance requirements or to reflect changes to our Service or business. When these Terms are revised, the date at the top of the page will be updated to the effective date of the changes to the Terms. Please check this page periodically for updates. Changes to the Terms are effective from the date of revision, and your use of the Service after the date of the change represents agreement to the updated terms.
